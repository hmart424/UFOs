# UFOs

## Overview of Project 

The purpose of todays project is to help provide Dana a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings, we are going create a HTML page that allow users to filter
for multiple criterias in additon to the data, youll be able to filter threw the city, state , country, and shape. 

## Results

The results came back and they are amazing, we have a dynamic webpage. Upon opeing the page we are greeted with a opeing and a title with a picture on top. 
as the client scorlls you are able to see filters on the right side of the page with options for; Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. You are able
to filter threw more than one option at the same time. On the right hand side he have our results in a dynamic table setting.

## Summary

In summary we have created a dynamic html page with multiple search functions. One drawback to the webpage is the discreptions i feel like there is not 
enough infromation dispalyed making it hard t validate certain claims. There a couple recommendations that would make the website better in my opinion the 
frist being adding a filter to search for the source of the sighting. The second being making the discreption longer. With those two things i think the 
webpage would benefit dearly!
